## What is it?
Do you remember buying physical media? There's something about holding a CD or vinyl in your hands - reading the lyrics or the liner notes as you listen to the album. This feeling of physicality is missing in our current day, where streaming has taken over. 

The Spotify Experience aims to recreate that feeling by tapping into your now-playing music on Spotify and brings in a ton of additional context about what you're listening to. Detailed artist and song info, analytics, the ability to queue up similar tracks, and more are available through this app.
